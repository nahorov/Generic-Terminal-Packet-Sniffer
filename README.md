# Generic-Terminal-Packet-Sniffer
This is a Packet Sniffer in C to be run on the terminal. Works best in Linux and Unix-like systems. 
It is to be natively compiled on the system, so GCC is a prerequisite. This project was made in C 17, and is compatible with GNU GCC 11 and above.

# For Unix-like systems:
chmod +x packet-sniffer.sh <br>
sudo ./packet-sniffer.sh

<br>
NOTE: Given that the results are going to be printed onto a log file, sudoer or root privileges are necessary to execute this program, and also to view and review the log file. That is not to be avoided or circumvented.
